# Day 1 - Linux + WSL Setup

## What I did
- Installed and ran Ubuntu on Windows using WSL
- Learned basic Linux commands: ls, cd, mkdir, touch, nano
- Created files and folders in Ubuntu
- Started a local server on localhost:8000
- Used the 'top' command to monitor system usage

## Important Commands Learned
- ls — list files
- cd — change directory
- mkdir — create folder
- touch — create file
- nano — edit file
- python3 -m http.server — start server
- top — monitor system

## Key Learnings
- WSL allows Linux to run inside Windows safely
- Localhost is used for testing before cloud deployment
- System monitoring is a core SRE responsibility
